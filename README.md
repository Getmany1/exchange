An efficient C++ implementation of the exchange word clustering algorithm

Optimizes bigram perplexity by swapping word between classes. The evaluations
can be done in parallel in multiple threads.

One sentence per line is assumed. Sentence begin and end markers (<s> and </s>)
are added to each line if not present in the corpus. Perplexity values include
the sentence end symbol. Subword text can include word boundary markers (<w>).
